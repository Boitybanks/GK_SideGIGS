# SideGigs — guidance for Claude Code

Hyperlocal South African work marketplace where every customer-confirmed gig becomes a verified portfolio record.
Source of truth: `.pipeline/idea.md` (brief), `docs/architecture.md` (design), `.pipeline/assumptions.md` (decisions).

## Stack
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 (`src/`), Supabase Postgres/Auth/Storage (project ref `plzbbfoteevfpqxspyxi`),
Netlify hosting + Functions (`netlify/functions`, site `sidegigs-codecraft`).

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (functions need `netlify dev`)
- `npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npm test` · `npm run build` — all must pass before commit
- `npm run test:journey` — full P0 journey against the LIVE database using demo accounts (creates demo-flagged data)
- `npm run keys:generate` — post-quantum keys (public → `src/lib/pq-public-keys.ts`, secrets → `.env.pq`, never commit)

## Rules that matter
- Trust-bearing writes (gigs status, applications, reviews, portfolio, transactions, events) go ONLY through
  `security definer` RPCs in `supabase/migrations/*_rpc_functions.sql`. Never add direct table write grants for them.
- Fee = 15% admin fee deducted from the worker's pay: the customer pays the job price (`gigs.total_cents` = `payout_cents`),
  the worker receives `gigs.worker_net_cents`; all generated columns. `src/lib/money.ts` only mirrors them.
- Portfolio records are created only by `confirm_completion`. "Verified" means customer-confirmed, never ID-verified.
- Addresses/phones are X-Wing (ML-KEM-768+X25519) → AES-256-GCM envelopes encrypted in the browser; decrypted only in
  `netlify/functions/reveal-contact.mts` using the caller's JWT so RLS decides access. No service-role key anywhere.
- Payments are a labelled simulation. Demo data is `is_demo = true` and badged in the UI.
- Mobile-first: test at 360 px; bottom tab nav on mobile.
- New migrations: add a file under `supabase/migrations/` and apply it to the project; re-run Supabase security advisors.
